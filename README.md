# To Do List by Tireon

It's my first pet project. Here I practiced to develop on React

### Stack:
1. JS
2. React (useState, useMemo, useEffect, useContext)

I used functional components. I made some decomposition when I considered it needs.
Next, I used hook useContext to avoid props drilling and localStorage to store the list of tasks on user's drive.
Thanks to which You won't lose your tasks even after you close ur browser or refresh the page.
I made modal window to add new task.
